# DapperCandyShop
This project is a rebuild of my earlier repository 'Candy Shop'. https://github.com/DanBixler/Candy-Shop

It is a web-based demo of a candy shop, which was originally built with .NET Core 3.0, Twitter Bootstrap, and Entity Framework.

In this repository, I will build it again using Dapper Micro ORM instead of Entity Framework to connect to the databse.  I will also make a few other improvements along the way.
